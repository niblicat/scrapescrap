      "text": "DEARBORN, MI\u2014In an effort to raise money to cover his mounting legal bills, former President Donald Trump announced at a campaign event Friday that he was selling the central religious text of Islam in a special new edition called the \u201cGod Bless The USA\u201d Quran. \u201cIt\u2019s a very holy book\u2014really the holiest of all the Qurans you can buy\u2014and it\u2019s time for America to bring back the word of God as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad,\u201d said Trump, who promoted his version of the scripture sacred to Muslims by standing in the minaret of a mosque and stating through a loudspeaker that the $60 book was the only Quran inspired by country singer-songwriter Lee Greenwood\u2019s signature hit. \u201cNo other Quran is officially endorsed by Trump, so get yours while you can. Order now, and you\u2019ll also receive a complimentary Trump 2024 prayer rug, inshallah.\u201d The former president added that he would also soon begin offering \u201cGod Bless The USA\u201d Torahs, Vedas, Confucian Analects, and Tao Te Chings."
