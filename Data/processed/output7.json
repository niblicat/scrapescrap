      "text": "HUDSON, NY\u2014Saying that the woman was getting to the age where she could no longer afford to be so picky, local matchmaker Cassidy Williamson asked one of her clients Monday if she\u2019d be open to dating outside her species. \u201cSo,  you have a lot of great things going for you, but just by chance, would you be at all interested in a nonhuman partner?\u201d said Williamson, who added that while the 33-year-old might not be able to tick off everything on her wish list, expanding her search to a wider swath of the animal kingdom would certainly help. \u201cI know you requested someone affectionate, loving, and intelligent, and there are many animals besides Homo sapiens that can provide that for you. Just think about it. Alvin, a very well established possum, or Xander, a sun bear from the Atlanta Zoo, might just be the perfect fit.\u201d At press time, Williamson\u2019s client agreed to give it a shot after the matchmaker promised that even though the majority of her animal clients were only 2-foot-4, they more than made up for it in personality.
