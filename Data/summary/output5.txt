Boomers Try To Define The Word ‘Rizz’
Boomers hilariously attempt to define Gen Z slang term "Rizz" as "razzmatazz," "rat jizz," "kill all white property owners," and more, showcasing a humorous generation gap. Misinterpretations include linking it to rappers, Vietnamese chemical agents, and even vodka enemas. The satire pokes fun at their struggle to keep up with modern language.
